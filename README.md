# Unmaintained C# Example Loader

Zen is a basic particle loader which can used for almost anything, I decided to re-upload on request of another user. I only updated the particle system in the loader and due to this example being fairly old, I recommend you to update the api which can be found here [c# api]: https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example
