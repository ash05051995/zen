# Unmaintained C# Example Loader

Zen is a basic particle loader which can used for almost anything, I decided to re-upload on request of another user. I only updated the particle system in the loader and due to this example being fairly old, I recommend you to update the api which can be found https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example

# Missing Dll Files

* Error regarding the Guna UI2 dll missing, you can re-download using the package manager
* Erro regarding the particles.cs dll file missing, this can be downloaded from the site here https://uixdesign.xyz/threads/particles-cs.19/

# Adding Key

In the login.cs form fill in the following information below:

```public static api KeyAuthApp = new api(name: "", ownerid: "", secret: "", version: "1.0");```

# Further Updates

No (Unmaintained C# Example Loader) Make sure you see https://github.com/KeyAuth/KeyAuth-CSHARP-Example/blob/main/Console/Program.cs for a more updated example 

Make sure to use Keyauth to your advantage by including functions such as KeyAuthApp.checkblack, KeyAuthApp.ban ect...
